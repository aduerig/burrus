For each test

1) INPUT
  A) Read test board state
  B) Read correct list of move possibilities
  C) Read correct board states for each move
2) Set board state
3) Get list of move possibilities
  A) Compare list of move possibilities with correct list
4) If 3A is all correct, make each move
  A) Compare each move's next board state with correct board state
5) If 3A is wrong, print out correct list, incorrect list, differences

square numbers are as follows:

56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63
48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55
40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47
32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39
24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
